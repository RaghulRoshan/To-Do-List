Here’s a detailed **README** you can use for your GitHub repository based on your To-Do List web project (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`):

# 📝 To-Do List Web App

A simple, clean, and responsive To-Do List built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This app helps users keep track of their tasks by allowing them to **add**, **check off**, and **delete** items. It also uses **localStorage** to persist tasks across browser sessions.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### HTML (`index.html`)

* Sets up the structure with a heading, input field, add button, and task list.
* Links the stylesheet and JavaScript file.

### CSS (`style.css`)

* Styles the app with a beautiful gradient background.
* Applies modern layout styling with padding, hover effects, and icons for tasks.
* Adds custom check icons and styling for completed tasks.

### JavaScript (`script.js`)

* Handles user interactions:

  * `addTask()` creates new tasks.
  * Clicking a task toggles the `checked` class.
  * Clicking the "×" icon removes a task.
  * All changes are saved to `localStorage`.

## 💾 Local Storage

The `saveData()` function ensures that all tasks remain saved even after the page is reloaded. The `showTask()` function restores them on page load.

## 📌 How to Use

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list.git
